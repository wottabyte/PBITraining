The main bed was fine but the sofa bed folded out sloping the frame was bent and so making the mattress sloping downwards. We just took the mattress off and put it on the floor.

My only complaints are the noises in the early morning when businesses load their goods and the hidden fee of cleaning service. It was indicated on the confirmation page that additional fee of 50 will be charged by the hotel at check in/out. However, the hotel only informs me at my arrival that I stay more than 3 nights, so the additional fee will be 130 instead of 50. I understand the whole resort/cleaning fee, and I do not mind to pay 130 if I am informed in advanced. I book hotels very frequent and I understand the resort fee usually bases on daily. If not, the property will inform the slum sum amount before customer decide to book or not. At castle kona reef, cleaning happens once a week, so we do not get room cleaning during our stay. Room is not fresh and clean by the end of the day. The kitchen has ants everywhere. The fridge is not extremely clean. Therefore, 130 is a bit too much.

The unit was hot and the air conditioner was placed at the opposite end from the bedroom which was also off to the side, past the kitchen, laundry and bathroom. We couldn't open the windows because of the traffic noise (motorcycles burning rubber, cars, buses, tour vehicles honking horns and people shouting after weddings etc) and the sun blared through the windows on that side because the blinds were missing at least a quarter of their slats. All the blinds were dirty, stained and broken. The kitchen was nicely appointed with every appliance we needed (after we fixed the burner which was in backwards).
